<div>
    <p>Controls whether the "Use Groovy Sandbox" is shown in pipeline jobs configuration page to users without Overall/Administer permission.</p>
    <p>This can be used to get a better UX in highly secured environments where all pipelines are required to run in the sandbox (ie. running arbitrary code is never approved)</p>
    <p>Note that this does not prevent users to configure and run pipelines with sandbox disabled if they create or update jobs by other means (like CLI or HTTP API).
        This option is only hiding the checkbox from the HTML UI</p>
